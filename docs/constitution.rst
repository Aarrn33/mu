Our Values
----------

Happily, Mu's users and developers are a diverse and international community
who maintain a reputation as a friendly, welcoming and dynamic group.

We trust that such collaborators will treat each other in a way that reflects
the widely help view that diversity and friendliness are strengths of our
community to be celebrated and fostered.

We believe anyone involved in Mu's community has a right to:

* be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;
* be free from any form of discrimination, victimisation, harassment or
  bullying.
* enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behaviour, inappropriate language
  and unsuitable imagery.

In Case of Problems
-------------------

Problems within any community are inevitable. We hope, if at all possible, that
folks try to work out their differences with compassion, patience and
forgiveness. However, we understand that sometimes, problems cannot be resolved
in such a way.

In this case please contact the administrators via email: <email TBC>

Any contact will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated, and
dealt with sensitively. Mu admins reserve the right to carry out any of the
following actions relating to community related problems:

* Persons concerned may be asked to stop/modify their behaviour.
* Persons may be warned that enforcement action may be taken if such behaviour
  continues.
* Persons may be blocked from further participation in the Mu project via the
  communication channels controlled by Mu administrators.
* If appropriate or required by law, a problem may be reported to the Police or
  other suitable authority.
